    <h1>RetailMeNot Shopping App</h1>

    <div class="section hero">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>To create a more discovery and top-of-the-funnel experience for users, RetailMenot began exploring the possibility of building a marketplace app that could engage young, female shopping enthusiasts. The team ran a series of user concept tests to help gauge the viability of this type of product and to help solidify the design strategy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
           <p>Aspirational affordability became a unifying principle in the concept. We wanted to provide a mini "me-time" shopping escape for users on their phones. We knew we would be focusing on apparel, accessories, and beauty, but the content strategy was still open-ended.</p>
         </div>

      <h3>Round 1 Testing</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>In the first iteration of the test, one of the main goals was to understand whether this product belonged in our existing RMN coupon app or if it should be a standalone product.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>Users have a very positive affinity for the RMN brand, but also one that is very utilitarian and transactional. We needed to understand the impact of this on the app. The prototype was clickthrough flats to facilitate a cognitive walkthrough.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <img class="" src="images/shoppingApp02.png">
      </div><!--/row-->

      <div class="row">
       <div class="six columns"><p>We also wanted to get a sense of the information architecture, and what unit of content users felt most comfortable interacting with.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="six columns"><p>Collections provide context, while a product feed provides quick, lightweight engagement.</p>
       </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <img class="" src="images/shoppingApp03.png">
      </div><!--/row-->
      <div class="six columns">
        <p>Finally, to get a quick sense of people's emotional response to color, imagery, typography, we showed users variations of collection tiles.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <p>Did certain approaches feel more high-end? Do more editorial elements change the way people think about this content? Do these look like ads?</p>
      </div>
       <div class="row">
        <img class="" src="images/shoppingApp04.png">
      </div><!--/row-->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
         <p>Users' responses revealed that the utilitarian aspect of the current RMN app created expectations of breadth and discounts in our content that was not part of the initial business strategy. However, the RMN brand provided added trust and recognition that would prove to be valuable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
         <p>Also, our content strategy didn't quite resonate with users. We needed to refine how we grouped products and categories to give users a more curated experience, and we needed to further articulate the relationship between RetailMeNot and the merchants in the app.</p>
        </div>
      </div><!--/row-->

      <h3>Round 2 Testing</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>In this next test we brought the prototype into higher interactive fidelity, allowing users to explore full collections of content and move about the app freely. We established that the experience would be about "treating yo' self", provide guilt-free browsing, be content first (feel "navigation-less"), and when possible, surprise and delight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>Both versions would be standalone apps, one RetailMeNot branded and the other independent. Version A, was organized by collections that were trend and theme-based. We pushed farther the affective quality by playing with color, imagery, and texture. Version B would be RetailMeNot branded and be all about quick, lightweight ways to consume content.</p>
        </div>

      </div><!--/row-->

      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
         <p>User feedback was very positive. We observed users naturally shopping in the app and getting excited about the deals they were finding. Both approaches met a different need for users.</p>
         </div>
        <div class="six columns">
         <p>However, users&rsquo; primary behavior was to shop to buy and the category filtered product feed facilitated this well. Collections served a secondary need to keep up with trends and discover new styles.</p>
        </div>
      </div><!--/row-->
    </div><!--/section iteration-->

    <div class="section mocks">
      <h3>Round 3 Testing</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>This final round of testing combines our learnings and will support how we approach a pilot recommendation. We combined the product feed and collections and further fleshed out the checkout process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>We wanted to address the confusion around multiple merchants and how fulfillment works. This test digs deeper into the mental models users have around buying through a third party content provider. </p>

    <p>This series of test were successful in confirming the viability of this concept and next steps will be to design out the pilot to test in market.</p>
