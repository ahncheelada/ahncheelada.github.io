    <h1>Macmillan Writing Tools</h1>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>Macmillan had recently acquired a web-based, educational writing tool to help high school teachers facilitate multi-draft writing and peer review. I was brought in on the project as the lead designer from Theresa Neil Strategy &amp; Design to work with the internal product and engineering team and redesign the tool for first-year college composition students and integrate the experience into their umbrella learning platform. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>As this learning platform was still in transition and the team was fairly new to having a dedicated designer, they needed help with how the design and research process would work with the overall goals and timeline of product development. I worked with the product team to craft a UX roadmap to ensure we were designing iteratively and testing with users, while hitting the important cross-functional team milestones.</p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>After an inventory and evaluation of the current product, we interviewed instructors to map out the user journey and phases of the site architecture, including an MVP and longer-term vision product.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>The writing product had a few key experiences: the instructor feedback tool, the writing assignment creation flow, the student drafting and revising tool, and the student peer review experience.</p>

      <h3>Instructor Feedback</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>The instructor feedback tool is a core component and went through several concept test iterations to reflect writing pedagogy in a way that was flexible for experienced instructors but could also provide guidance for newer writing instructors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>We had to strike the right balance and emphasis between formative, higher-order feedback and the more tactical copy editing and grammatical instruction.</p>

      <h3>Instructor Assignment Creation</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>When creating a writing assignment, it was important that the instructors could visualize what the students were going to see while creating content. We used a more modular approach so instructors could directly edit the student template.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>We also tested different ways to represent the relationship between the summative rubric scoring and formative draft goals.</p>

      <h3>Student Drafting &amp; Revising</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>For students, we focussed on task completion and the ability to comprehend the multi-step process in draft revision and peer review. We also had to redirect an over focus on grades to encourage experimentation and reflection significant in higher education writing courses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>Though mobile was considered for all experiences in the tool, it was clear through interviews that the main opportunity for mobile would be for students. Though most would not be drafting their papers on their phone, students were pleased to be able to review assignments, feedback, and provide short answer reflections on-the-go.</p>

    <p>Through each phase of testing and design, I coordinated with the engineering team, providing production assets and helping to establish a design to development workflow. I eventually handed the project off to another member of the TNSD team.</p>
