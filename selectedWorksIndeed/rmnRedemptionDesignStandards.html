    <h1>RetailMeNot Design Standards: Coupon Redemption</h1>

    <div class="section hero">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
        <p>As the team continued to iterate on the RetailMeNot site, and new platforms, such as app and social, were introduced, local optimizations led to divergent design decisions and a disjointed experience for users. From a development perspective, we were redesigning and building in isolated silos rather than a holistic system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
        <p>An inventory of the coupon format illustrated how even at the most essential element, the coupon, we were forcing users to relearn interactions everytime they moved from one channel to another. This issue was widespread amongst all experience elements, from navigation to overall visual language, but a significant first step was to unify the coupon redemption experience.</p>

      <h3>Inventory</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
        <p>We began with understanding, from a content perspective, what existed. I spent some time interviewing the Operations Content team to get a sense of what types of coupons existed, why we created this coupon type, and what current content needs were not being met. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
        <p>I also met with all the different product owners to track down every coupon touchpoint and potential changes in the future. What I found was that from a user perspective, there should only be a handful of "coupon types", but from a content perspective, we had many.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
        <p>Another important aspect in the experience was the context of the coupon and how that impacted the redemption and conversion user flow. At each stage of interaction, we should be deliberate with the information and calls-to-actions we are showing users. I mapped specific details to questions a user might be asking pre-click, post-click, and return.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
        <p>Based on what we'd heard in research, depending on where the user is on the site, they may also have a different mode of engagement. Certain search-driven pages are much more task-oriented, whereas the home page is likely more discovery-oriented. These contexts roughly fell into four types: Transactional, High-Intent Browse, Low-Intent Discovery, and Push.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
        <p>From there, I started mapping out the individual components. The goal was to create a single offer-level element that would be modular and could be used across all contexts. Each of the four contexts would have it's own coupon design based on the mode of engagement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
        <p>The key aspects of the post-click offer pertaining to the coupon would be the same across everything, but the central redemption module could be swapped out depending on the offer type. A featured coupon would allow for merchants to showcase their branding.</p>

    <div class="section results lastSection">
    <p>This set the groundwork to align coupon interaction and for a consistent model to think about user contexts. A cross-functional team was later formed to establish a unified visual language across the whole of the RetailMeNot experience.</p>
