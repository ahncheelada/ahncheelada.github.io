      <p>As a way to provide more in-store deals for users, weekly ad content from brick-and-mortar stores were introduced to inform users of upcoming sales and leverage existing collateral merchants were already investing in. Success of the product would be greater engagement and time on site.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
      <p>The MVP would be a cross-platform web view of the print material with interactive hotspots highlight certain sales and available coupons. The ability to find a nearby store would help users take the next step in redeeming these deals.</p>

      <h3>Sketches</h3>
      <div class="six columns">
      <p>I started by exploring different ways of showing large print ads in a digital format and sketching out specific interactions for mouse and touch.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
      <p>I wanted the content to feel immersive, so the user did not feel restricted by the viewport. I also wanted to maintain some of the tactility of print media</p>

    <div class="section mocks">
      <h3>Iteration 1</h3>
      <div class="six columns">
      <p>In the first iteration, we played around with category filters. On first view, users would be able to see the full pamphlet. The edges of subsequent pages were a quick mental marker and preview of the content. On interaction, pages would open up and navigation would collapse.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
      <p>We designed for responsive web. Tablet and Desktop shared similar layout with adaptations for touch and pinch to zoom.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <img class="" src="images/circulars01.png">

      </div><!--/row-->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
         <p>When we took the design into usability, we found that there the relationship between pagination and zooming caused a lot of confusion for users. And though more intuitive for users, the mobile menu was awkward and in the way for most users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>Further, features such as the category filters didn't match users' behavior with weekly ads. Users were used to quickly flipping through pages to get a glance at the content. Refining through filtering was unnecessary and perceived as more effort.</p>

    <div class="section mocks">
      <h3>Iteration 2</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
         <p>Based on user feedback we removed category filters and refined the pagination and zooming paradigms. We used animated elements to highlight the in line coupons and added the ability to input location</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>Navigation was moved to the top to enable a full width view of the circular, improve the mobile layout, and to solve for awkward ad dimensions. A quick summary of the available coupons was added to the header.</p>
